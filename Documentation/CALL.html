    <h1>CALL (Call Instruction)</h1>
    <p>
      CALL and RCALL are instructions 124 (0x7C) and 125 (0x7D) respectively.
      They instruct the processor to perform a call to the address on the stack
      and set the base pointer to the final stack pointer.
    </p>
    <p>
      STACK: [8-byte addr] -> [8-byte prev bp] [8-byte address of instruction
      after CALL]
    </p>
    <p>CALL performs an absolute call to the address (ip = addr).</p>
    <p>RCALL performs a relative call to the address (ip += addr).</p>
