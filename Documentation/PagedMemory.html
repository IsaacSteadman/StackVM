    <h1>StackVM Paged Memory Model</h1>
    <p>
      Common abreviations in this document:<br />
      - PTE: Page Table Entry
    </p>
    <p>
      StackVM implementations which support paged memory will indicate this with
      a flag in the SYS_INFO_G system register
    </p>
    <p>
      When a page walk is initiated, there are a few possible errors that may
      occur. One such error is that the final page table entry (the one that
      points to the physical memory of the page) does not have the correct
      permission bits. Another error is that one of the page table entries
      encountered along the walk was invalid. This may not be an error for
      example if the kernel is trying to store data to memory in userspace
      through a pointer that was passed through a syscall In this case we do not
      want a Page Fault to result from this so the page walker needs to return
      how the error occured
    </p>
    <p>
      The StackVM paged memory models can be enabled with the appropriate flag
      in the SYS_MAIN_PTE system register. <br />
      When paged memory is enabled the physical memmory address of the top level
      PTE is stored in SYS_MAIN_PTE.<br />
      The most supported modes for virtual memory are 4 level page table
      systems. <br />
      The one most like intel x86-64 is defined below:<br />
      - the page size is 4KiB, 2MiB or 1GiB<br />
      - The upper 52 bits of the physical address of the top level page table is
      PML4 = SYS_MAIN_PTE[63:12]<br />
      - All PTEs are 8 bytes in size and contain a 52 bit pointer to the next
      frame<br />
      - A virtual address ADDR is translated to a physical one as follows:
      <br />
      - using 9 bits to index each page table entry<br />
      - pte_4_ptr = (SYS_MAIN_PTE &amp; PTE_MASK) + ADDR[47:39]<br />
      - pte_4 = M[pte_4_ptr] &amp; PTE_MASK<br />
      - pte_3_ptr = pte_4 + ADDR[38:30]<br />
      - pte_3 = M[pte_3_ptr] &amp; PTE_MASK<br />
      - pte_2_ptr = pte_3 + ADDR[29:21]<br />
      - pte_2 = M[pte_2_ptr] &amp; PTE_MASK<br />
      - pte_1_ptr = pte_2 + ADDR[20:12]<br />
      - pte_1 = M[pte_1_ptr] &amp; PTE_MASK<br />
      - physical address = pte_1 + ADDR[11:0]<br />
      The next 4 level virtual memory mode is defined below:<br />
      - the page size is 8KiB, 8MiB or 8GiB<br />
      - The upper 51 bits of the physical address of the top level page table is
      PML4 = SYS_MAIN_PTE[63:13]<br />
      - All PTEs are 8 bytes in size and contain a 51 bit pointer to the next
      frame<br />
      - A virtual address ADDR is translated to a physical one as follows:
      <br />
      - using 10 bits to index each page table entry<br />
      - pte_4_ptr = (SYS_MAIN_PTE &amp; PTE_MASK) + ADDR[52:43]<br />
      - pte_4 = M[pte_4_ptr] &amp; PTE_MASK<br />
      - pte_3_ptr = pte_4 + ADDR[42:33]<br />
      - pte_3 = M[pte_3_ptr] &amp; PTE_MASK<br />
      - pte_2_ptr = pte_3 + ADDR[32:23]<br />
      - pte_2 = M[pte_2_ptr] &amp; PTE_MASK<br />
      - pte_1_ptr = pte_2 + ADDR[22:13]<br />
      - pte_1 = M[pte_1_ptr] &amp; PTE_MASK<br />
      - physical address = pte_1 + ADDR[12:0]<br />
